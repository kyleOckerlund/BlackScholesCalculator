This project is intended to be a simple Black-Scholes calculator, for two reasons: For myself, it's a good pipeline test. For a general audience, it will hopefully serve as a sample of my programming style in a sort of portfolio piece. Much of the code I've written has been proprietary in some way or another, but I'm hoping this will be a minimal demonstration. 


N.B, typically I'm more of a heavy planner for my code, but for this one, I don't think I'll need much more than the above.
